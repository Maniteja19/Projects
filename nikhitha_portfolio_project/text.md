I am an engineering student ,trying to learn photography in a Complex and uncomplicated manner . I engage mostly in nature photography and i am just a beginner .  
So Why do i choose Photography ?
I pursue nature everytime and capture in many ways . We can redefine creativity through the surroundings . It leads to a path where our brain can think in many different ways .

Naturephotography Consists of :

Animals&reptiles

Birds

Flowers

Insects&Spiders

Landscapes&seascapes

Flowers& birds&Landscapes are my area of interest . I capture flowers mostly and also sky.
I mostly enjoy outdoor photography and also one should take preventive measures to lower the risk of skincancer . Flowers make for great photography subjects, particularly if we have a few different varieties to choose from. Their vibrant colours are almost synonymous with springtime, so what better to do than to capture them blossoming in all their beauty?There are a lot of details to be explored, from petals to pollen, leaves and developing buds. Try isolating the various parts with a macro lens for a fascinating new perspective.

Here is the thing about the outdoor photography .
Outdoor photography gives a lot of pleasure and relaxation to mind . I feel more pleasant through this, so i always choose outdoor only . This is best for the people who have travelling obsession .

Photographs are the universal language of our era.I capture because i feel the beauty in it . we shouldnot forgot the beauty of nature surrounded by us . photos never age , and it shows what we miss in our dailylife . Every picture i takes , has its own story left behind .
Photography speaks . when i understood photographic Visual language , i thought this language can educate audience with out the need of shared spoken language . So this makes me more passionate about photography .
