            <p>
              I am an engineering student ,trying to learn photography in a
              Complex and uncomplicated manner . I engage mostly in nature
              photography and i am just a beginner .
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Flowers & birds & Landscapes are my area of interest .</h3>
            <p>
             I capture flowers mostly and also sky. I mostly enjoy outdoor photography
              and also one should take preventive measures to lower the risk of
              skincancer . Flowers make for great photography subjects,
              particularly if we have a few different varieties to choose from.
              Their vibrant colours are almost synonymous with springtime, so
              what better to do than to capture them blossoming in all their
              beauty?There are a lot of details to be explored, from petals to
              pollen, leaves and developing buds. Try isolating the various
              parts with a macro lens for a fascinating new perspective.
            </p>
            <br>
              <h3>Here is the thing about the outdoor photography .</h3>
              <p>Outdoor photography gives a lot of pleasure and relaxation to mind . I
              feel more pleasant through this, so i always choose outdoor only .
              This is best for the people who have travelling obsession .
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>So Why do i choose Photography ?</h3>
            <p>
              I pursue nature everytime and capture in many ways . We can
              redefine creativity through the surroundings . It leads to a path
              where our brain can think in many different ways .
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Photographs are the universal language of our era.I capture because i feel the beauty in it . we shouldnot forgot the beauty of nature surrounded by us  . photos never age , and it shows what we miss in our dailylife . Every picture i takes , has its own story left behind . 
Photography speaks . when i understood photographic Visual language , i thought  this language can educate audience with out the need of shared spoken language . So this  makes me more passionate  about photography .
